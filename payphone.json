Baby, it's all wrong\n\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\n\nIf happy ever after did exist\n\nI would still be holding you like this\n\nAll those fairytales are full of shit\n\nOne more fucking love song, I'll be sick\n\n\n\nYou turned your back on tomorrow\n\nCause you forgot yesterday\n\nI gave you my love to borrow\n\nBut you just gave it away\n\nYou can't expect me to be fine\n\nI don't expect you to care\n\nI know I said it before\n\nBut all of our bridges burnt down\n\n\n\nI've wasted my nights\n\nYou turned out the lights\n\nNow I'm paralyzed\n\nStill stuck in that time when we called it love\n\nBut even the sun sets in paradise\n\n\n\nI'm at a payphone trying to call home\n\nAll of my change I spent on you\n\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\n\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\n\nIf happy ever after did exist\n\nI would still be holding you like this\n\nAll those fairytales are full of shit\n\nOne more fucking love song, I'll be sick\n\nNow, I'm at a payphone\n\n\n\nMan, fuck that shit\n\nI'll be out spending all this money\n\nWhile you sitting around wondering\n\nWhy it wasn't you who came up from nothing\n\nMade it from the bottom\n\nNow when you see me I'm stuntin'\n\nAnd all of my cars start with the push of a button\n\nTelling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it\n\nSwitched the number to my phone so you never could call it\n\nDon't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'\n\nSwish, what a shame, coulda got picked\n\nHad a really good game but you missed your last shot\n\nSo you talk about who you see at the top\n\nOr what you could've saw\n\nBut sad to say it's over for\n\nPhantom pull up, valet open doors\n\nWished I'd go away, got what you was looking for\n\nNow it's me who they want\n\nSo you can go take that little piece of shit with you\n\n\n\nI'm at a payphone trying to call home\n\nAll of my change I spent on you\n\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\n\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\n\nIf happy ever after did exist\n\nI would still be holding you like this\n\nAll those fairytales are full of shit\n\nOne more fucking love song, I'll be sick\n\nNow, I'm at a payphone"
